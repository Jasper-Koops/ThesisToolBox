# ThesisToolBox

# A simple webapp to scrape the Hansard database, organize sources and link them together with tags and comments 

The Brittisch parliamentary database (hansard / https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/index.html) leaves a lot to be desired. They are updating the website but this will take time and much of the search functionality has been disabled during the migration process. 

ThesisToolBox comes equiped with a scraper to download the sources of the hansard archive to its own postgres database.
